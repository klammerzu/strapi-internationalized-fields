# Strapi plugin internationalized-fields

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha-Version
This plugin is currently in alpha. Contributions are welcome!

## ‚ùì Why this Plugin?

### The Problem
Beside Strapi beeing one of the best CMS out there, it faces some critical issues when it comes to internationalization. As every translation is stored as seperate entry in the database, the need to manage relations across multiple entries makes working on complex projects very hard.

### The solution
This plugin introduces a _custom field_ that stores all translations within a single entry. This reduces the need for enabling Strapi's i18n and therefore makes working with translateable relations reasonable.

## ‚è≥ Installation
Install the plugin:
```bash
# with npm
npm i @klammerzu/strapi-internationalized-fields
# with yarn
yarn add @klammerzu/strapi-internationalized-fields
```

Add this to your `config/plugins.[js|ts]` file:
```ts
export default ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  'internationalized-fields': {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

Then build the app:
```bash
npm run build
```

You now can find the _Internationalized Text_ field unter _Custom_ when adding new fields.

## üíæ API Output
Behind the scenes the plugin uses Strapi's `json` field type. The locales will be delivered automatically, without further configuration or population. The resulting response will look like this:

```json
{
  "field_name": {
    "en": "My field value.",
    "de": "Irgendwas auf Deutsch.",
    "fr": "Je ne parle pas francais."
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration
Look that you have the i18n plugin enabled. There is no futher configuration needed. The plugin automatically detects the configured languages.

### Hint
Don't use `internationalized-fields` on models with enabled `Internationalization` as they conflict each other.
